# Problem 19
## I had solved it on my own
But chatgpt had a better solution. I found it really smart to add a dummy node at the front of the linkedlist, something I had never thought of before.
I actually took this knowledge, and practiced it in Java just because I could. 


## I learned from this
Even though chatgpt provided me a cleaner answer, I didn't just take this for granted. Unprompted, I was able to complete problem 3217 quickly and cleanly, because I was able to recognize the pattern.
