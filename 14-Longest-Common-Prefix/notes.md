# 14 Longest Common Prefix

## Lessons Learned
I had overcomplicated this problem initially. In searching for the most common prefix amongst strings in the array, I had wrongly assumed that "common" had meant "occurs in at least 2 or more strings."

This was not the case. It turns out, "common" typically means "occurs in all elements in the array." Once I realized this, I was able to solve the problem in sub 10 minutes.
